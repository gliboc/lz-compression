Code produced during my internship at Purdue.

## Install

Recommended, using [pipenv](https://docs.pipenv.org/)
```
pipenv shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```



## Usage


`python main2.py -s <filesave>` if you want to do simulate an experiment of
a certain number of words of a certain length generated by a Markov source.

`python main2.py <datafile>` loads a dataset of words and prints graphs representing
different normalized instance of the number of phrases required by LZ78 to parse the words.

`python main2.py [-m | -v] [--file datafile | --save filesave]` simulates and conducts mean
or variance analysis on a dataset of words, saving it as `filesave`, or loads a dataset from `datafile`,
and prints histograms and graphs for visualization.
