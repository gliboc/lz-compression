Example:
$w = c|a|ac|ca|acb|cacb$
we picked the longest pair |v|+|t| thinking it 
will give us less phrases
This is basically a two-step greedy algorithm

Results :
$\sqrt{n} \leq M_n n \log_2(n)$

Todo:
- get convinced of the loss equality 
$sth - Loss(j) = max {sth}$

- read the original paper on flexible parsing

- get convinced by their final result
