	abstract = {It is well known from a theoretical point of view that LZ78 have an asymptotic convergence to the entropy faster than LZ77. A faster rate of convergence to the theoretical compression limit should lead to a better compression ratio. In effect, early LZ78-like and LZ77-like compressors behave accordingly to the theory. On the contrary, it seems that most of the recent commercial LZ77-like compressors perform better than the other ones. Probably this is due to a strategy of optimal parsing, which is used to factorize the text and can be applied to both LZ77 and LZ78 cases, as recent results suggest. To our best knowledge there are no theoretical results concerning the rate of convergence to the entropy of both LZ77-like and LZ78-like case when a strategy of optimal parsing is used. In this paper we investigate how an optimal parsing affect the rate of convergence to the entropy of LZ78-like compressors. We discuss some experimental results on LZ78-like compressors and we consider the ratio between the speed of convergence to the entropy of a compressor with optimal parsing and the speed of convergence to the entropy of a classical LZ78-like compressor. This ratio presents a kind of wave effect that become bigger and bigger as the entropy of the memoryless source decreases but it seems always to slowly converge to one. These results suggest that for non-zero entropy sources the optimal parsing does not improve the speed of convergence to the entropy in the case of LZ78-like compressors.},

	abstract = {In combinatorics and analysis of algorithms often a Poisson version of a problem (called further Poisson model or poissonization) is easier to solve than the original one, which we name here as the Bernoulli model. Poissonization is a technique that replaces the original input (e.g., think of balls thrown to urns) by a Poisson process (e.g., think of balls arriving according to a Poisson process to urns). More precisely, analytical Poisson transform maps a sequence (e.g., characterizing the Bernoulli model) into a generating function of a complex variable. However, after poissonization one must depoissonize in order to translate the results of the Poisson model into the original (i.e" Bernoulli) model. We present in this paper several analytical depoissonization results that fall into the following general scheme: if the Poisson transform has an appropriate growth in the complex plane, then an asymptotic expansion of the sequence can be expressed in terms of the Poisson transform and its derivatives evaluated on the real line. Not unexpectedly, actual formulations of depoissonization results depend on the nature of the growth , and thus we have polynomial and exponential depoissonization theorems. Renormalization (e.g., as in the central limit theorem) introduces another twist that led us to formulate the so called diagonal depoissonization theorems. Finally, we illustrate our results on numerous examples from combinatorics and the analysis of algorithms and data structures (e.g., combinatorial assemblies, digital trees, multiaccess protocols, probabilistic counting, selecting a leader, data compression, etc.).},
