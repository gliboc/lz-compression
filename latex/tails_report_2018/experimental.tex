\subsection{Simulation details}

The goal of this process is to simulate the Markov Independent model
for data generated by a Markov source. Here is a description of this 
model :

Given $n$ an integer, and $M()$ a Markov source.

\begin{itemize}
    \item Initialize an empty dictionary $parse$ \\
    \item Do $n$ times :
        \begin{itemize} 
            \item Generate the caracters of a new sequence with $M()$ until 
                  this sequence doesn't appear in $parse$. \\
            \item Generate a last symbol with $M()$: this is the Tail
                  Symbol.
        \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

We repeat this process $n_{\text{exp}}$ times in order to sample the 
distribution of the tail symbols, and for a range of values $n \in \text{ns}$.
