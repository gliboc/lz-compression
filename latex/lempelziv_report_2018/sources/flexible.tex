\section{ Optimal parsing}

Among my other research work at Purdue, I was asked to review the draft
of a paper~\ref{langiu_speed_2018} by Italian researchers which have collaborated 
with my supervisor in the past. Their current field of study is Optimal Parsing in the case of 
LZ'77 and LZ'78 - which can be resumed as a dynamic partionning of a data 
sequence into blocks in order to improve the efficiency of the LZ algorithms.
They explore the question which arised from practical use~\ref{mahoney_large_nodate}:
why is LZ'77 in practice more efficient than LZ'78, even though in theory LZ'78 is 
asymptotically better than LZ'77 as its compression ratio converges towards
the entropy lower bound faster than LZ'77 ? This was an interesting work
as it gave me the occasion to understand and apply the Flexible Parsing 
algorithm, and make some minor contributions to its analysis and presentation.
I wrote a report which I sent them over the course of June and I will now present
excerpts from it, among with some of the context around their work.

% \subsubsection{ Practical uses of LZ77 }

% Although it is based on the same approach of identifying 
% previously seen phrases - but storing them in a fixed size 
% dictionary instead of an evergrowing parse tree like in LZ78 -
% the LZ77 algorithm is the most used in practical implementations
% of universal compression algorithms.

% Let us dive in on a few of the most recent ones :

%     \item DivANS
